# Surveillance-de-s-curit-avec-Cowrie-SSH-Honeypot-
This project sets up a realistic SSH honeypot using Cowrie to simulate a vulnerable SSH server. It collects the attack logs and sends them to Elasticsearch for real-time analysis and visualization in Kibana. Alerts are automatically sent via Slack when suspicious activities are detected.
